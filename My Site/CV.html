        <h3><u>PERSONAL PROFILE</u></h3>
        <p><h4><div>Over the years, I have gained considerable skills, qualities, and experience that I believe are a strong match for this IT support role. I have outstanding customer service skills, I always work at a fast pace, I have a diverse range of knowledge and technical ability that means I can solve all IT-related problems, and I always take responsibility for my professional development. Whilst working in my previous role, I was often praised by my manager for being a creative problem solver and an integral and trustworthy member of the team, looking to bring this experience into a new sector of IT support. Whilst I appreciate you are interviewing lots of talented people for this position, I believe my excellent teamwork capabilities, my supportive and caring nature, and the fact that I am commercially aware means I can come into the role and start making a positive contribution immediately.</div></h4></p>
